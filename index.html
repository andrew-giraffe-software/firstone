    <p>Hello, it's me <br>
        I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
        To go over everything<br>
        They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br>
        But I ain't done much healing<br>
        Hello, can you hear me<br>
        I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
        When we were younger and free<br>
        I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet</p>
